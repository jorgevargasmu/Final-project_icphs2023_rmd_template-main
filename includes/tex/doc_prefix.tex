\begin{abstract}
This pilot study tested whether undergraduate Spanish learners could determine whether stimuli were produced by AI or a human. The results showed that both groups distinguished between AI and human voice. Additionally, F0 and speech rate were inspected using Praat, and the analysis showed they exhibited similar values.
